    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Hot dogs are a popular street food and casual meal enjoyed around the
      world. They consist of a cooked sausage, typically made from beef, pork,
      chicken, or a blend of meats, served inside a soft, sliced bun. The
      sausage is usually pre-cooked and often grilled or boiled. Hot dog buns
      are soft and elongated, perfectly shaped to cradle the sausage.
